### Problem 
- There are various types of bot accounts created by users used for different purposes such as boosting follower count of selected users, 
  advertising their product or message to other people by spamming random people’s messages or commenting in random post with the help of web scripts and dummy accounts.
- There are various accounts which create posts about political and business agendas to publish their views to general masses. This practice in general creates hate on the platform and not a healthy environment for other users.
